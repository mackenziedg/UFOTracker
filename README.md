## Description

Despite the U.S. government's explicit expression of disinterest in U.F.O. research, U.F.O. Sightings have sparked interest in Americans from coast-to-coast. Avid U.F.O. enthusiasists have collected data on U.F.O. sightings throughout the years at the National U.F.O. Reporting Center. Our data analysis explores what factors or demographics make an American more likely to report a U.F.O. sighting? Or what common characteristics do U.F.O. sighters share?
